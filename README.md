# Chess Game with Automatic Speech Recognition

This is a chess game that utilizes automatic speech recognition technology to allow players to make moves through voice commands.

## Motivation

Moving the chess pieces requires fine motor skills and dexterity, which can be challenging for individuals with physical disabilities. As a result, these individuals may not have the opportunity to enjoy the many benefits of playing chess.

Our project seeks to address this challenge by creating a chess game that can be played through voice commands. By removing the need for physical manipulation of the pieces, we hope to make chess accessible to a wider range of individuals, including those with physical disabilities.

## Features

This project is a voice-controlled chess game that allows players to make moves through voice commands. The game is built using a combination of Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno, along with a CNC shield V3 to move an electromagnet under the board for manipulating the chess pieces. Microsoft AZURE's text-to-speech technology was used for the voice recognition feature, and programming was done using both Python and C languages.

Various algorithms were implemented to detect and respond to user commands, resulting in a 90% accuracy rate and positive user feedback. The project demonstrates the potential of combining cutting-edge technologies to create a unique and user-friendly gaming experience that can be enjoyed by individuals with physical disabilities.

## Technologies Used

The system was built using the following components and technologies:

### Software Components

-   Microsoft AZURE's text-to-speech technology
-   Python
-   C language
-   [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl)

## Installation

Instructions for installing and setting up the game will be provided in the future.

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1.  Set up the chessboard with the pieces in their starting positions.
2.  Turn on the system and run the "run.py" script.
3.  Speak the voice command to make a move, such as "E2E4".
4.  The electromagnet under the board will move the appropriate chess piece to its new position.
5.  Repeat until the game is finished.

## Conclusion

The chess board project is a remarkable demonstration of how technology can improve a traditional game. By combining a CNC printer, Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 4, and natural language processing technology, the project has greatly enhanced the game experience. The use of natural language processing technology allows for more intuitive interactions with the chessboard and has the potential to revolutionize the way we play chess. While there are still opportunities to improve the project, such as developing a new model based on letters and words only and adding a camera to the setup, the successful completion of this project inspires further exploration of the possibilities of merging technology and traditional games. Overall, this chessboard project is a promising example of how technology can be used to elevate classic games and experiences.
